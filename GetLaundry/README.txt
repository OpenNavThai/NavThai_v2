Read order using filenames:
Start
B
AB
ATM
Lnd

You can read ATM or Lnd in whatever order you fancy, but because ATM is shorter it should go first in an organized list.

The reason ATM section is numbered despite containing a single picture is to make it easier for someone modifying the guide to add further stops that go direction.
