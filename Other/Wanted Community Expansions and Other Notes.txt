This is a note that came with NavThai v2 before the OpenNavThai reboot and expansions.  It is dated to the 10th of December, 2024, which is... to memory, maybe a week(?) before NavThai v2 was initally made public on the Discord server now known as Astra's HQ.

It is presented here unmodified for history's sake.



------ Wanted Community Expansions (Overview)

My hope with starting this set of guides (something I purposefully played into with the licensing structure) is for this to become a collaborative exercise for support people as well as patients with good mobility who are healing well to work together in expanding and building a shared community knowledge of the local area which can be expanded freely by anyone with a camera on them and/or the knowledge and time of day.

As of time of writing (this note was started on 10 Dec 2024, before any of these guides were made available to the public) I don't know how much further I can do to further these goals, but I feel like it would be a good start to at least list some things needed so that someone wanting to help has something actionable to work towards.

That is what this first section will be.  If the contents note are made public (which I fully consent to and want), then please make it possible for people to add their own requests for expansions which need to be made.

Please do, also, keep that list of requests somewhat organized so that it can act like a checklist for people.

--- Wanted Community Expansions (List)
- Walking to a fresh foods grocery store
- Details on the nearby 24 hour laundramat by the 7-11
- How to walk to the hospital (low priority)
- Expanded details on the walkable mall
Please add more to this list as needed.


------ Other Notes

While I understand and find it reasonable if not everyone making their own guides licenses theirs similar to how I did mine, I would really like to and hope to see internal rules put in place which allow similar levels of modification and resharing of guides made for patients and support people on the Discord server, probably with a provision that they cannot be shared outside of the Discord server to the general public.  That way, all of the benefits of the licensing that I have been doing applies while few to none of the downsides do.

It's important to me that something to this effect is done, because I don't believe that the freedom of information that I am imagining is only possible with people being able to make corrections to other people's guides; improving them over time, and giving them the impression of having been held, remolded, and made by the whole community.

I would understand if that is not done, but nevertheless all of my work, so long as I am legally able, is licensed with a specific Creative Commons license which I believe to be the best of all worlds, and which cannot be stripped from my work by somebody modifying it.
