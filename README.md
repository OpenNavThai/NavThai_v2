# NavThai v2 public Git archive

Hi, this is Nicolete, creator of NavThai v2 and co-creator of NavThai v3.

This repository contains everything that was in the NavThai v2 release on MEGA, but not the "Context Text" later created for it as a part of a planned rerelease on Astra's HQ, as that was made obsolete by the introduction of NavThai v3 not extremely long after.

I may later add that "Context Text" if there is enough demand or I have the free time, as it was only ever seen by a select few.

These guides are being made so easily available to the public primarily as a stop gap while NavThai v3 is being finished, but also for the sake of the historical record and any future public interest.

There are no changes made to it's licensing, so anything you could do with it before you still can now.

The only changes made to this version are to some text files, including the removal of one text file which I decided was best to keep to only a curated selection of people (it's still available on Astra's HQ).

All the best,
Nicolete
